Yelp Clone
==========

This project is a clone of [Yelp](http://www.yelp.co.uk/). The goal is to introduce you to Rails, focusing especially on:

- Associations
- Validations
- AJAX in Rails

This is version 1 of the project, without styling and completed in one day. I pair programmed with [Meads](https://github.com/meads58).
